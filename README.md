# PRESENT_simulation
simulation of the power traces for the PRESENT 80 bit key version encryption.

``captured`` folder will contain the traces generated, ``eg_plots`` contains some example plots which were genrated using
```
key = 0xab987654def32c01f456
PT = 0x987654321
```
The idea behind designing the simulation is explained in this [blog](https://udionblog.wordpress.com/2017/06/22/simulating-power-traces-of-a-spn-cipher-present/).
